# JavaFinal
A Unity Video Game originally for my Java Class, Procedural.Knight is the current name

# Version 0.0.1 (38MB)
June 2nd, 2025

Functions:
Melee fighting and Procedural Generation seems to work, hosted on a Linux server as of right now using local IP address as connection method. 

Bugs/Non-Functions:
Archer and Mage class still dont function, Archer is semi coded but the arrow doesnt fly very far and cannot deal damage due to maybe hitting the player firing it? Multiplayer is only available through the local network with the server and nowhere else seemingly, build requires windows downloaded app to function - Web integration not complete. None of the art is really completed to any amount so characters look pretty bad.
